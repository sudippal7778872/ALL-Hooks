useReducer()

this is similar to useState.
here we have same concept of reduce method.

syntax:-
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialValue);
// in initial state we can pass multiple object same as useState hook.
//here reducer is a pure function. we can define it anywhere. also in another page as well.
it takes to parameter 1. state and 2. action

reducer(state, action){
return something;
}
// and always need to return something. like reduce function.
